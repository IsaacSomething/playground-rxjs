      'UPDATE: TREASURE HUNT REVEALED!\n\nCavalry Audio has unveiled a real-life digital treasure hunt - the clues to which are hidden across the nine episode first season of X Marks The Spot.\n\nThe prize for solving? $50,000.\n\nMake sure that you’re subscribed to the podcast and following all of Cavalry’s social accounts as to not miss any clues & hints along the way! \n\nWhat are you waiting for? Go find that treasure!\n\nThe first and only podcast series that investigates the real life treasure hunt that captivated the globe. The podcast follows the incredible story of Forrest Fenn, a New Mexico art dealer who, in 2010, reportedly buried $2 million in gold somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. Fenn then published an autobiography that contained a six stanza poem that allegedly gave clues to the exact location to anyone clever enough and brave enough to figure it out. The hunt enticed hundreds of thousands of searchers from around the world, cost five unfortunate souls their lives, and spawned at least three lawsuits in the wake of the treasure’s discovery in June of 2020. The series contains never-before-heard interviews from people who were close with Fenn, treasure hunters who spent years in the chase, and even a few who claim to know where the treasure chest was buried.',
